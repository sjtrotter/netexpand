# netexpand
> Expands networks given in CIDR, dashed, or splat format.

netexpand takes a given network (which can be notated with CIDR or in a dashed format), and expands the network; i.e. it prints each valid address within the network given.

CIDR:   x.x.x.x/x

dashed: x.x.x.x-x

splat:  x.x.x.\*

NOTE: Network notations should not be mixed; program reports error and exits on detection.

Default behaivor prints each valid address to stdout. Also includes an option to randomize the output addresses.
